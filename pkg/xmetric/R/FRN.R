## FRN.R
## This is a the function for calculating the Fill Rate Numerator using the poisson distribution
## for an initial stock level (j), demand rate (Lam), and average time to restore (t).
## This function is presented as equation 4.2 in "Statistical Theory of Reliability and Life Testing, 
## Probability Models" by Richard E. Barlow and Frank Proschan.
