## EBO.r
## This is a the initial function for calculating the Estimated Back Orders assuming a poisson distribution
## for demand given a an initial stock level (j), demand rate (Lam), and average time to restore (t).
## This function is presented as equation 2.7 in "Optimal Inventory Modeling of Systems", by Craig C. Sherbrooke.
